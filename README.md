This project is a copy/fork from code.google.com/p/elt - I'm not the author of any of the code.

I'm not planning of developing/supporting it further.

This is just a backup in case of Google Project Hosting going down.

If you are original author of this project and do not want me to store it - send me a message and I will remove it.
